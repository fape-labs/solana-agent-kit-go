# Solana AI Agent Toolkit

An **open-source Golang toolkit** designed to connect AI agents to Solana protocols and make all Solana operations fully autonomous. This toolkit simplifies the process of integrating AI-driven decision-making into Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) and beyond.

## 🚀 Features

- **Jupiter Swap Integration**  
  Perform token swaps autonomously using the Jupiter protocol.

- **Pump-Fund Actions**  
  Automate liquidity or funding actions to interact seamlessly with Solana protocols.

- **Extendable Framework**  
  Additional actions and integrations are in progress! The toolkit is built with extensibility in mind, allowing contributors to add new features easily.

## 🎯 Mission

Our mission is simple: enable fully autonomous operations on Solana. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or community contributor, this toolkit provides a foundation for building and scaling intelligent agents within the Solana ecosystem.
